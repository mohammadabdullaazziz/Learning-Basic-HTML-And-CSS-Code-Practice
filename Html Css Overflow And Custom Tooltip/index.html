<h3>Bangladesh</h3>
<p>Bangladesh gained independence on December 16, 1971, following a brutal nine-month war of liberation against Pakistan. The conflict was marked by widespread atrocities and a significant loss of life. The independence movement was fueled by linguistic, cultural, and political differences, with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerging as the leader of the new nation.</p>
